# Decision Log

## Purpose
This document is an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) style log capturing *why* significant technical decisions were made, so the reasoning isn't lost or locked in one person's head — important given the team has a single senior developer.

## Scope
Covers significant, hard-to-reverse technical or architectural decisions (e.g., choosing Modular Monolith over Microservices, choosing PostgreSQL, module boundary decisions).

**Out of scope:** day-to-day implementation choices that don't affect the broader system.

## When to Update This Document
- Whenever a significant technical or architectural decision is made.
- Whenever a previously recorded decision is revisited or reversed (add a new entry; do not delete the old one).

## Recommended Sections
- Decision Entry Template (Context, Decision, Status, Consequences)
- Chronological list of decisions (newest first)

## Decisions

### ADR-007: Frontend HTTP client must not swallow `AbortError`, and queries use `networkMode: 'always'`
**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
While smoke-testing the Users web feature against a live dev server, a query against a deliberately-unavailable backend got stuck showing a loading state indefinitely instead of settling into an error. Investigation traced it to two compounding issues in `frontend/shared/api-client/httpClient.ts` and the default React Query configuration: (1) the HTTP client wrapped every `fetch` rejection — including a deliberate `AbortError` from query cancellation — into a generic `NetworkError`, which defeats React Query's ability to distinguish "cancelled on purpose" from "really failed"; (2) the default `networkMode: 'online'` can pause retries based on perceived connectivity rather than surfacing a prompt error.

**Decision**
`HttpClient.request()` now rethrows `AbortError` unchanged instead of wrapping it. `queryClient`'s default `networkMode` is set to `'always'` for both queries and mutations, so a failed request always settles into a catchable error rather than an indefinite paused/loading state.

**Consequences**
Network failures now reliably reach the UI's error-handling path (docs/FrontendArchitecture.md §8) instead of occasionally hanging. Both web and mobile `queryClient.ts` carry this configuration; any future module reusing the shared HTTP client gets the fix for free.

### ADR-006: Users module layers are `internal`, with `InternalsVisibleTo` granted only to the unit test project
**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
The approved backend architecture states that only a module's `Contracts` namespace is public; `Domain`/`Application`/`Infrastructure` should be `internal` so other modules and the host can't accidentally reach into them. The first implementation pass left everything `public` for expediency.

**Decision**
`User`, `IUserService`/`UserService`, `IUserRepository`/`UserRepository`, `UserErrorCodes`, `UserMappingExtensions`, and both validators are `internal`. `IdentityDbContext` and `UserConfiguration` remain `public` (Database.Migrations legitimately needs them — the one sanctioned cross-project exception the architecture already documents). `HMS.Modules.Identity` grants `InternalsVisibleTo("HMS.UnitTests")` so unit tests can exercise internals directly; no other assembly gets this grant. `HMS.ArchitectureTests` enforces this boundary going forward via NetArchTest rules, since reflection can inspect internal types without needing the grant.

**Consequences**
Every future module should follow the same pattern: internal by default, `Contracts` public, `InternalsVisibleTo` scoped only to that module's own unit test project, and an architecture test asserting it.

### ADR-005: EF Core migration for `identity.users` is hand-authored; `Designer.cs`/`ModelSnapshot.cs` are intentionally omitted
**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
The .NET SDK is not installed in the environment this module was built in, so `dotnet ef migrations add` could not be run. The migration's `Up()`/`Down()` methods are ordinary, reviewable C# and were hand-written to match `UserConfiguration` exactly. The `.Designer.cs` and `ModelSnapshot.cs` files, however, are tool-generated, reflection-driven, and must be byte-for-byte consistent with the live model — a hand-written approximation risks being subtly wrong in a way that silently corrupts the *next* migration's diff.

**Decision**
Ship the hand-authored `Up()`/`Down()` migration as a reviewable reference, but do not fabricate the Designer/Snapshot files. A README next to the migration documents the exact `dotnet ef migrations add` command to run (and diff against) once the SDK is available.

**Consequences**
The migration cannot be verified to actually apply until someone runs it against a real PostgreSQL instance with the real tooling. This is a known gap, not a silent one — see the Phase 10 quality checklist in the Users module delivery notes.

### ADR-004: Controller-based endpoints (not Minimal API) for module HTTP surfaces
**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
The backend architecture document left the `Endpoints/` layer's implementation mechanism open ("Minimal API or Controllers"). Building the first reference module forced a concrete choice.

**Decision**
Use ASP.NET Core MVC controllers (`[ApiController]`, `ControllerBase`). Each module's controller lives in its own `Endpoints/` folder but requires a `FrameworkReference` to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` since modules are plain class libraries, not Web SDK projects.

**Consequences**
This is now the precedent every future module follows for consistency. Controllers were chosen over Minimal API for familiarity (attribute routing, model binding, filters are well-understood by a team with mixed experience levels) — not because Minimal API is unsuitable; this could be revisited if a future module's needs push toward Minimal API instead, but the choice should stay uniform across modules rather than mixed.

### ADR-003: Manual DTO↔entity mapping instead of AutoMapper/Mapster
**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
docs/Architecture.md §7 recommended Mapster (or AutoMapper as an alternative) for Application↔Contracts mapping. With a single entity in the first module, either library is pure overhead.

**Decision**
Use a small static extension method (`UserMappingExtensions.ToResponse()`) instead of adding a mapping library dependency.

**Consequences**
Revisit once a module has enough DTOs/entities that hand-written mapping becomes repetitive boilerplate rather than a one-line method — likely by the third or fourth module. Until then, every module should follow this same manual-mapping pattern rather than introducing a library independently.

### ADR-002: Central Package Management (`Directory.Packages.props`) adopted for the whole backend
**Date:** 2026-07-22
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Building the first module required adding several new NuGet packages (EF Core, Npgsql, FluentValidation, testing libraries) across multiple projects.

**Decision**
Every package version is declared once in `Directory.Packages.props`; individual `.csproj` files reference packages by name only.

**Consequences**
Adding a package to a new module means adding/reusing a `<PackageVersion>` entry at the root and a bare `<PackageReference Include="..." />` in the project — no version number is ever repeated. Keeps every module on the same package versions by construction.

### ADR-001: The `User` entity carries no credential/authentication fields
**Date:** 2026-07-22
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
The Users module was explicitly scoped to exclude authentication, JWT, login, and refresh tokens for this iteration (see docs/modules/Identity/Users.md).

**Decision**
`identity.users` (and the `User` domain entity) has no password hash, credential, or session-related column. Only profile data (name, email, phone) and the standard audit columns exist.

**Consequences**
When the Authentication iteration begins, credential fields are added to this same table as purely additive columns — no redesign of the existing schema, entity, or API contracts is expected. If that assumption turns out to be wrong (e.g., credentials need a separate table for security-isolation reasons), record that as a new ADR when it happens.
